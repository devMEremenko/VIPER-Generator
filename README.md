Hi there!

I created this repository to show how **Xcode File Template** can be used.

As a good example, I selected **VIPER module**. It contains a number of files and classes that should be created and configured. 

Please check out the template and generated example to understand how it works.

To add a template to Xcode just follow these steps:

1. Place `Swift VIPER Module.xctemplate` folder to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`. (create a folder if it does not exist).
2. Open any Xcode project, press `Cmd + N` and scroll down to the bottom.
3. Select `Swift VIPER Module` and enter a name of the new module.
4. The new folder with files will be created. Please remove it as a reference and add to your project again.
